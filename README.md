# gas-calculator
A small project I started for fun. I challenged myself to using multiple libraries in Java as well as the Google Maps distance matrix/query API to expand my knowledge. This project is more of a technical demo than a utilitarian one.

Libraries used Java-side:

- JavaFX
- Jython (originally, found out its abandoned)
- py4j (after finding out Jython was abandoned)
- ControlsFX (add-on to JavaFX)

Libraries used Python-side:

- json
- requests
- py4j
- Google maps distance matrix/queries API

TODO:
- unbind gateways after initializing, they keep throwing errors
- fix file path NPE error
